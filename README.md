# Muda Muda Service
## Overview
"Muda" means "useless" in Japanese and is a catchphrase of one of my favorite characters, Dio, from *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure*. 
The phrase is iconically used during ultra-fast punchouts with the protagonist.  It fits nicely with the theme of this service,
which is supposed to be a low-latency, high-volume k8s service.  At least that's the goal - I may try different experiments
to better understand the characteristics of different design patterns and some might work better than others.

## Setup
This is a Golang based service requiring go 1.17 or higher to run.
